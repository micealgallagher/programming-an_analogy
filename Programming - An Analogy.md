#Programming - An Analogy

## The Black Box
Programming is the creation of black boxes; take some input, do something with it and return the output. Vending machines are black boxes. Provide coins and a selection (input), based on the selection, check the correct amount has bee tendered (do something with it), then vend the product (output).

By the same virtue programs are black boxes; take input, do something with it and produce an output. 

Sometimes the output of one black box is the input for another. Combining multiple black boxes together we could create a more complex black box. A program to select a contact on your phone can be passed to one that sends text messages.

A black box can be made publicly available by placing it somewhere like a park. The internet is a huge park that allows access to programs  

When a black box doesn't work as expected it can log what it's doing. Programs can log what they are doing allowing programmers to debug them.
