# Programming - An Analogy
One night while out with my wife I was asked by an aquaintance, "So what do you do?" to which I replied "I'm a software developer - a computer programmer" to which she replied "I literally have no idea what my follow-up question should be". While I admired her candor, the mental image of all the people who had asked the same question and then stared glass eyed as I responded, was inescapeble.

Feeling like the fault was due to my explaination, I decided to create an analogy to make the topic accessible.

Please, feel to use it when next you are asked the question.
